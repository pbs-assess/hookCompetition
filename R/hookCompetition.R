#' hookCompetition: A package for computing censored-Poisson relative abundance
#' indices from longline data.
#'
#' The hookCompetition package provides three categories of important functions:
#' bootstrapped unadjusted methods, non-spatial model-based censored GLMM-based
#' methods, and spatio-temporal model-based censored ST-GLMM-based methods. The
#' package is written in INLA which allows for multi-threading.
